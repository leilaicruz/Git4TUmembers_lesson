# How to make certificates that maintain a template but only changes one item like Name, Date, etc 

## Step 1: Prepare Your Google Slides Template
	- Create a Google Slides document that will serve as your certificate template. Design the certificate layout as needed.
	- Mark placeholders in the template that you will replace with personalized information (e.g., [NAME], [DATE], [COURSE]).
	- The ID of your template is on the url of the slide. For example, if the URL of a presentation is:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W47G9K0IoZOWrFH_U9-Wj68CgrUvqWUF0h17uHNQ/edit#slide=id.f6c90a8d-cce3-11c7-a34e-c6fa1cb0cc11

Then the presentation ID is: 1W47G9K0IoZOWrFH_U9-Wj68CgrUvqWUF0h17uHNQ
i.e. the hash immediately after /d/ and before /edit


## Step 2: Prepare Your Google Sheets Spreadsheet
	- Create a Google Sheets document with the information of the participants.
	- Include necessary details like names, email addresses, dates, courses, or any other information that needs to be personalized on each certificate.
	- The ID if your sheets follows the same logic as for the google slide

## Step 3: Write the Google Apps Script
	- Go to your Google Sheets document.
	- Click on Extensions > Apps Script.
	- Copy the script names "create_certificates_GoogleScript.js"
	- click Run
